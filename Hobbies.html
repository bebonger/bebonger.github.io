            <h3>My journey in osu!</h3>
            <p>
                I started playing in March 2017 when a friend of mine insisted that i tried out the game. At first i would only play whenever my friend asked me to,
                but i gradually started to get more interested in the game, practicing in my own free time and getting better, slowly but surely. Around mid-December 2018,
                I was at a level where I could be called an amateur at the game. At this time, a player called 'sinn' spectated me at 3am in the morning while i was playing
                casually, and invited me to to the osu!Singapore Discord community server. This was the start of many new encounters in my life. I started to get more active in the game, 
                speeding through the rankings and participating in numerous community tournaments to test my skills. However, that made me realise my skillset was not very
                well received in the community. This pushed me to further improve my gameplay and on January 12 2019, i became one of the top 100 players in the world. However,
                this was still not the end. Finally on April 27 2019, I overtook the #1 Player of Singapore at that time and I still hold the crown to this day. I will continue
                to represent Singapore in international tournaments if I have the time to do so as school is now eating away at my existence
